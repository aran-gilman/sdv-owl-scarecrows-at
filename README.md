# Owl Scarecrows for Alternative Textures

This is a conversion of [Ankokou's Owl Scarecrows mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/936) into an [Alternative Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9246) content pack.

## Requirements

* [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)
* [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)
* [Alternative Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9246)

## Known Issues

Currently, all rarecrow textures are available to every rarecrow, including for random selection when placing the rarecrows in the world. 

## Credits

Credit for all textures goes to Ankokou; I just split up the file and wrapped them for AT.
